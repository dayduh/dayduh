Hi, thanks for checking out my GitHub my name is *Max Batsch*

I’m interested in leveraging big data to glean insights on a number of different aspects of life. Some of my particular interests are machine learning and neural networks. 

I’m currently learning how to more effectively turn data into a story that will move people and institutions.

I’m looking to collaborate on projects that both challenge me and utilize skills previously learned in my previous stats and machine learning courses.
